# install-Rmd-pkgs

This action installs packages that are usually necessary to render LandR module 
manuals (.Rmds). 

Some manual .Rmds may require additional packages which 
will need to be installed separately, unless they become shared across many modules
in which case they should be added to this action.

Note that this action requires the packages `remotes` and `Require` to be installed,
which can be done via the [`install-Require`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/actions/tree/main/install-Require)
action.
